### **Project Title:**  
**Baby Name Trend Analysis (1980–2010)**

### **Project Overview:**  
This project explores U.S. baby naming trends using 30 years of Social Security birth name data (1980–2010). The dataset includes baby names broken down by state, gender, and year, providing a rich foundation for analyzing historical shifts in name popularity, regional naming preferences, and unique name patterns across time.

The primary objective was to use SQL and PostgreSQL to derive insights from raw data and uncover patterns that reflect societal, cultural, and geographic influences on name choices.
